\subsubsection{Choices at the client}
In two of the algorithms a delay was used to limit the amount of readings from the GPS in the experiments. Due to some permission problems on the platform this is done by sleeping the thread in stead of using the timer. When doing delays based on an assumed maximum speed the delay for the next reading is done as a part of handling the response, to ensure that the delay calculation is done on the newest reading.

For the accelerometer a delay was introduced in the readings to make live analysis of data easier. The analysis was used to find an assumption of when the acceleration was big enough to assume movement. A value of $2 m/s^2$ was found as a reasonable threshold, by simulating walking with the phone and reading the accelerations. The delay was kept in the client during testing to avoid changing the results from our simulations.
