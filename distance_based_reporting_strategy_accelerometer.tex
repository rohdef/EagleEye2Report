\subsection{Distance-based Reporting Strategy - Accelerometer}
The readings from the accelerometer in figure-\ref{maxspeedaccelerometeraccuracy} have a spike at around location number 8, this indicates a GPS warm up, where the first location have a bad accuracy. From the fact that we had to breaks at one minute each two spikes is actually expected. This could be due to background applications doing GPS readings outside our control. But this can also be due to the accelerometer algorithm being too sensitive, which was also indicated by one of the test runs.

Apart from that the accelerometer seems to have a quite good accuracy of $\leq 6m$, and sends data at a rate of $1.3$ fixes per minute. The accelerometer reads GPS fixes at a rate of $42$ per minute.
