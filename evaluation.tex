\section{Evaluation}
To evaluate the project a route around Storcenter Nord with some fix points is chosen. It takes approximately 9 minutes to walk the route, which fits well when two stops of each 1 minute are added. The fix points are the some location across the different algorithms, but with a unique elapsed time measured for each.
