\subsubsection{Server protocol - TCP}
The client makes a TCP connection to the server and sends the location serialized as one line. It makes it possible for the server to store each received location as a line in a text file.

The decision was the TCP protocol over the HTTP protocol, due to the overhead at the HTTP protocol. Web pages, for which the HTTP protocol is designed, has different and extended needs such as cache, encoding and standard error codes. For a real world production environment the interest is a small protocol for a little data consumption of mobile traffic. Further more a small protocol with less data to be transferred is assumed to be faster and use the battery less. That is why the TCP connection is assessed to be best suited for this project.
