\section{Conclusion}
It is possible to reduce both the number of GPS fixes and the number of connections to servers, and still track the target. However the use case must be taking into account, due the different limitations of the algorithms. Depending on the use case the distance based with max speed (DBRS -MS) and accelerometer (DBRS - A) seems to perform quite well. The DBRS - MS does very few readings at the cost of accuracy, whereas DBRS -A gives very accurate locations, but also used a lot more readings. The DBRS - MS could be improved to gain further accuracy, but this would also increase the amount of readings. It also seems that a the alsorithms has weaknesses when the target does not walk in straight paths. But with these algorithms the battery consumption can be reduced and devices can use pervasive positioning for longer time.
