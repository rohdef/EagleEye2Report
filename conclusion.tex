\section{Conclusion}
It is possible to reduce both the number of GPS fixes and the number of connections to servers, and still track the target. However the use case must be taking into account, due the different limitations of the algorithms. Commonly they are best suited for targets, which primary move at a straight paths. But with these algorithms the battery consumption can be reduced and devices can use pervasive positioning for longer time.
