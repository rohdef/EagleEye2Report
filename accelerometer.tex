\subsection{Accelerometer}
The accelerometer measurements has the potential for a few improvements. First off our data could suggest that the detection of movement could be improved, a sliding window algorithm would probably improve the accuracy of the movement detection. Basically have the $n$ last magnitude ($\sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)-gravity$) readings and take the average of them. This could help remove noise from the user taking the phone or normal phone operations.

Also the threshold used to detect when something is considered as movement should be found by gathering empirical data of peoples movements, to find an appropriate $n$ for the sliding window and a threshold for how much movement that is needed to consider it movement.
