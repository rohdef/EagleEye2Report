\subsection{Distance-based Reporting Strategy - Max Speed}
During the analysis of the data from the distance based reporting with a maximum speed (MS), the accuracy distances was very high. The accuracy show how precise the location is where a low number indicates that you are close to your target. The DBMS and accelerometer is compared in figure-\ref{maxspeedaccelerometeraccuracy} it can be seen that the accuracies are way worse than for the accelerometer, this can also be seen on the Google Earth plot of the route.

The high numbers on the accuracy curve is probably due to the GPS switching off and having to do a cold start[REFERENCES]. This is also suggested by figure-\ref{locationsreadandsent} that shows way fewer readings by MS. The MS algorithm performs very well on the amount of locations read from the GPS at a rate of only $5.4$ messages per minute, but the accuracy should probably be better. It sends fixes to the server at a rate of $1.5$ per minute.
