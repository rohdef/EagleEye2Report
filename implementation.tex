\section{Implementation}
The project consists of the following two parts, A) an Android application (Client) and B) a Java application (Server). The client sends locations to the server, which stores the received locations. The client gets the locations of latitude and longitude from the build-in GPS. The client offers some different algorithms for requesting and selecting GPS locations. It makes it possible for the server to track to client.
