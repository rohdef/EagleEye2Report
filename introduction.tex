\section{Introduction}
Devices used for pervasive positioning often use battery power, which limits the use. Therefore it is suitable to reduce the consumption of the battery while estimating locations. This can be achieved by reducing the number of GPS fixes and the number of connections to servers. Hence this reduction is the focus of this project.

First of there is a description of the implementation including an user guide. Then the algorithms is evaluated and compared, followed by some reflections of extensions for the project. Finally there is a conclusion.
